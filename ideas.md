THESIS TITLE:
Description, application and implementation of YOLO Models.

THE OBJECTIVES:
Describe YOLOv7 model and show its implementation in a practical example.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:
Computer Vision is seeing an increasing number of industry applications. Monitoring and managing crop yield in agriculture, annotating and pinpointing anomalies in health care, facilitating warehouse logistics and manufacturing, and safety and navigation for autonomous vehicles. Nowadays implementation of this technology is unlimited and every year humanity is making a huge step in the development of this technology. One of the perspective models in this area is YOLO, which already shows great characteristics of recognizing objects.

WHY IS THE ISSUE IMPORTANT?
Computer vision software helps people solve the most difficult challenges and supports everyday tasks. With further development of this technology, humanity can increase the quality of life and solve main global issues like security and well-being, climate change, malnourishment and hunger.

*YOLOv7 is quite new, I will make research on this model to figure out if it will be doable to implement.
